## Two Types of Application
1. Stateful - Stores Data
2. Stateless - Doesn't Store Data

## Three Parts of Web Application
- Front End
- Back End
- Database

**Graceful Shutdown** - A graceful shutdown is when a computer is turned off by software function and the operating system (OS) is allowed to perform its tasks of safely shutting down processes and closing connections.

## NAT
Network Address Translation (NAT) is the process where a network device, usually a firewall, assigns a public address to a computer (or group of computers) inside a private network. The main use of NAT is to limit the number of public IP addresses an organization or company must use, for both economy and security purposes.

## CIDR Notation
A system called Classless Inter-Domain Routing, or CIDR, was developed as an alternative to traditional subnetting. The idea is that you can add a specification in the IP address itself as to the number of significant bits that make up the routing or networking portion. For example, we could express the idea that the IP address 192.168.0.15 is associated with the netmask 255.255.255.0 by using the CIDR notation of 192.168.0.15/24. This means that the first 24 bits of the IP address given are considered significant for the network routing.

## Gateway
A gateway is a network node that connects two networks with different transmission protocols together. Gateways serve as an entry and exit point for a network as all data must pass through or communicate with the gateway prior to being routed.

## Payload
When a transmission unit is sent from the source to the destination, it contains both a header and the actual data to be transmitted. This actual data is called the payload. The header contains the protocol information as well as the source and destination addresses, which are required for delivery of the payload. The payload is required by the destination client.
